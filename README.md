## Memory Game

For this project I built a browser-based memory game utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Players will be shown a collection of cards, face down, and can click on a card to reveal whatâ€™s underneath. After clicking on two cards, the game will check to see whether they match. If they do, they will remain facing up. If not, the cards will remain displayed to the player for 2 seconds, and then flip back down. The goal of the game is to match up pairs of cards in as few clicks as possible.

Some of the features of this game include:
- A timer that keeps track of the length of a single game
- A moves counter that keeps track of the amount of tries it takes for a player to match a card
